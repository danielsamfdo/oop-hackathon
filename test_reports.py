# EXAMINATION: MRI Lumbar Spine

INDICATION: Chronic low back pain, right lower extremity pain, radiculopathy.

TECHNIQUE: Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral spine is submitted with standard protocol, sagittal and axial T1, T2 and/or gradient echo sequences, without IV contrast. Exam performed on 1.5 Tesla MRI system.

COMPARISON: None

FINDINGS:

There is normal lumbosacral vertebral body height and alignment on this supine, non-weight bearing exam. Vertebral body marrow signal is normal. The conus medullaris is normal and terminates at L1.

|T12-L1:|Sagittal series-mild secondary discogenic facet change without stenosis.|
|---|---|
|L1-L3:|Sagittal series-normal disc spaces with patent canal and foramina.|
|L3-L4:|Series 6 image 10-normal disc space show mild/moderate facet arthrosis with patent canal and foramina.|
|L4-L5:|Image 21-mild to moderate decreased disc signal and disc height with mild endplate spondylitic change, bulge and a left paracentral disc herniation extruded superiorly, 7 mm AP by 16 mm mL by 14 mm CC, with the left L5 nerve root sleeve impingement in the lateral recess, with severe right more than left facet arthrosis. Narrowing of the thecal sac, 8 mm, with mild left lateral recess stenosis, patent right lateral recess and mild to moderate left and mild right foraminal stenosis.|
|L5-S1:|Image 32-mild decreased disc signal with mild/moderate decreased disc height and endplate spondylitic change, bulge and left paracentral disc herniation, 3 mm AP by 8mm mL, with left S1 nerve root sleeve impingement in the lateral recess, with moderate facet arthrosis. Patent canal and right lateral recess and right foramen with minor left foraminal stenosis. No paraspinal masses or collections.|

IMPRESSION:

1. L4-L5 left paracentral disc herniation extruded superiorly with left L5 nerve root sleeve impingement, with canal, lateral recess and foraminal stenosis.
2. L5-S1 left paracentral disc herniation with left S1 nerve root sleeve impingement with left lateral recess and foraminal stenosis."""

MRI Lumbar Spine (NEURO) WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST

TECHNIQUE: 

Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the Lumbar spine was performed without and with intravenous contrast. 

Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the Lumbar spine was performed without and with intravenous contrast. 

COMPARISON: Brain MRI performed 7/25/2021. Cervical and lumbar spine MRI performed 8/21/2021. 

FINDINGS:
Lumbar Spine:
The patient presents with diffuse degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine, most pronounced at the L5-S1 disc level. These changes are accompanied by mild disc space narrowing at L5-S1. Facet arthropathy is noted throughout the lumbar spine but remains within normal limits for the patientâ€™s age. No thecal sac compression is observed. The alignment of the lumbar spine is normal.

IMPRESSION: 
1. Degenerative Disc Disease, most prominent at L5-S1.
2. Disc space narrowing at L5-S1.
3. Diffuse facet arthrosis.
