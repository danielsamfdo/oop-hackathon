# International Framework for Red Flags for Potential Serious Spinal Pathologies

Identifying serious pathology as the cause of a person’s musculoskeletal presentation is complex. Red flags have historically been used to help clinicians identify serious spinal pathology, and the majority of guidelines recommend the use of red flags. However, guidelines are not consistent about which red flags should be considered when examining people seeking care for musculoskeletal disorders. This has led to confusion and inconsistency in the management of people when there is suspicion of serious pathology, and, in some cases, to unnecessary and worrying medical tests or false reassurance that there is no serious pathology.

We aim to provide clinicians with a more standardized and consistent approach to identifying people with potential serious spinal pathology. This framework has been developed by researchers and clinicians to provide a pragmatic approach for clinicians to screen for serious spinal pathology that can masquerade as musculoskeletal spinal conditions. The framework has been informed by available evidence and augmented by a formal consensus process that included academics and clinicians involved in the management of musculoskeletal conditions.

This framework aims to support a variety of health professionals, irrespective of experience, who provide care for people with musculoskeletal spinal conditions. Clinicians working in musculoskeletal services can play an important role in early identification of serious pathology, ensuring that people achieve the best possible outcome. The prevalence of serious pathology will vary depending on where in the clinical pathway the clinician has contact with the person. Spinal surgeons likely see more cases of serious pathology than general practitioners do, and physical therapists probably see a number in between, depending on where they are on their clinical pathway. Therapists working at an advanced-practice level are likely to see more serious pathology, as the populations they serve are likely to have more complex presentations.

Clinicians must consider the context within which red flags exist, and clinically reason the relevance of the information gathered to determine whether any action is required.

# Person-Centered Care

Working with people with possible serious pathology can be challenging, and a collaborative approach is essential. A possible diagnosis of serious pathology can be extremely worrying for people in regard to their families and careers. People must be involved in decision making.

SYNOPSIS: The International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists (IFOMPT) led the development of a framework to help clinicians assess and manage people who may have serious spinal pathology. While rare, serious spinal pathology can have devastating and life-changing or life-limiting consequences, and must be identified early and managed appropriately. Red flags (signs and symptoms that might raise suspicion of serious spinal pathology) have historically been used by clinicians to identify serious spinal pathology. Currently, there is an absence of high-quality evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of most red flags. This framework is intended to provide a clinical-reasoning pathway to clarify the role of red flags. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2020;50(7):350-372. Epub 21 May 2020. doi:10.2519/jospt.2020.9971

about their care, even when faced with a serious diagnosis. Shared decision making is essential to ensure that individuals are supported to make decisions that are right for them. Using a collaborative process, the clinician should highlight the treatment options, evidence, risks, and benefits and, together with the person, seek to understand how these fit with that person’s circumstances, goals, values, and beliefs.

Experts by Experience: How to Use This Framework

Clear and open communication with people with potential serious pathology is vital. People presenting with spinal pain may have no concept that their bladder or bowel function might be affected, or that the spinal pain could be caused by serious pathologies such as infection or malignancy. Providing the reason for the questions in the framework is an important aspect of the consultation, as some of these questions may seem irrelevant to a person who presents with back pain.

Effective communication about red flags is vital. People can become worried before an appointment, especially if they have seen something worrying on television or the internet, heard a story from a friend or relative, or experienced medical misdiagnosis.

Provide reassurance about why you are assessing for red flags, especially when the person is likely at low risk of having severe pathology. Consider the wording of your questions, your body language, tone of voice, and mannerisms when asking the questions.

People must feel at ease when answering questions and not judged (eg, intravenous drug use, poor social and environmental factors). Ensure people have sufficient time to consider and communicate their answers about something that they may never have considered before (eg, their toilet habits and how those may have changed).

Provide support regarding the emotional impact of being assessed for potentially life-changing conditions and, in some cases, being sent for further investigations. When asking about subjects such as previous history of cancer, it is particularly important to offer appropriate emotional support and, when needed, help people find other services that can offer further support.

How an International Framework Can Help Clinicians

This is an internationally agreed-on framework to aid early assessment and initial management of people who present with potential serious spinal pathology. These conditions, while considered rare, can lead to devastating and life-changing/life-limiting consequences for people. The neurological function and quality of life of people with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) can be preserved with early diagnosis, by facilitating rapid access to appropriate treatment, reduction in nerve damage, and maintenance of spinal stability. Substantial litigation costs can be incurred by health care providers if serious spinal pathology is not identified early and managed appropriately. Litigation relating to cauda equina syndrome (CES) alone accounted for £25 million ($40 million) in claims against the National Health Service in the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2015.

This international framework has been developed on behalf of the International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists (IFOMPT) and has been coordinated by researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University. Due to a paucity of primary evidence, the framework has been developed by expert clinicians’ interpretation of the highest-quality evidence available.

Key Term: Red Flags

Red flags are signs and symptoms that raise suspicion of serious spinal pathology. Until now, there has been little guidance on their use and they have been left to individual interpretation. For spinal pathology, 163 signs and symptoms have been reported as red flags, including 119 symptoms from the individual’s history and 44 signs from the physical examination.

The high number of red flags presents a challenge in terms of their everyday practical utility. Few red flags, when used in isolation, are informative. Red flags used in combination have promise, but further validation studies are required. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of red flag tests, and the evidence supports only a limited number of red flags to raise suspicion of serious pathology. There is no consensus on which red flags are most useful to identify serious spinal pathology or how they should be used in the clinical setting.

Despite the problems, red flag tests remain the best tools that health care practitioners have to raise suspicion of serious spinal pathology when used in combination with a thorough patient history and physical examination.

Key Clinical Messages

- There is a lack of evidence to support the informativeness of the majority of red flags commonly used in clinical practice.
- Few red flags, when used in isolation, are informative. Combinations of red flags demonstrate promise, but this work requires further validation.
- Red flags remain the best tools at the clinician’s disposal to raise suspicion of serious spinal pathology, when used within the context of a thorough subjective patient history and physical examination.
- Clinicians should consider both the evidence to support red flags and the individual profile of the person’s determinants of health (eg, age, sex) to decide the level of concern (index of suspicion) for presence of serious spinal pathology.

history and an appropriate physical examination. Serious spinal pathology is associated with increasing age, although serious pathology can affect all ages. Populations around the world are aging, which presents challenges, as people with increased medical complexity and morbidities present more often to musculoskeletal services. Consequently, therapists may see more patients with serious pathology.

Goal of the International Framework

Given the paucity of high-quality evidence to guide practice, we built this framework on multiple perspectives, including synthesizing the current research data, expert consensus and opinion, and steering-group consensus, to reflect an evidence-based practice approach. The framework is intended to provide clinicians with a clear clinical-reasoning pathway to clarify the role of red flags in identifying serious spinal pathology.

Decision Tool for Early Identification of Serious Spinal Pathology

The basis of our framework is a decision tool to help clinicians identify serious spinal pathology. The tool has 3 steps:

1. Determine your level of concern. Consider the evidence to support red flags and the individual profile of the person’s health determinants (eg, age, sex) to decide your level of concern (your index of suspicion) about the presence of serious pathology (FIGURE 1).
2. Decide on your clinical action, based on your level of concern determined in step 1 (FIGURE 2).
3. Consider the pathway for emergency/urgent referral. Know your local referral pathways and pathways to access specialist care if indicated (FIGURE 3).

Prioritize Serious Spinal Pathologies

In 2016, the member organizations of IF-OMPT, a subgroup of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy, identified 4 priority areas for discussion and research on red flags (incidence data presented in TABLE 1): CES, spinal fracture, malignancy, and spinal infection. The following sections summarize the red flags for each of the 4 prioritized serious spinal pathologies and outline risk factors, symptoms, signs, and initial investigations. Each section concludes with a series of clinical-reasoning scenarios.

|Red flags (supported by high-quality evidence)|Red flags (supported by consensus only)|

|Level of concern|Repeat visit?|

Method: Haute Autorité de Santé Consensus Method

This framework combines an evidence synthesis and international expert consensus. We followed the Haute Autorité de Santé recommendations for the development of clinical guidelines. Phase 2 Jisc Online Surveys (Jisc, Bristol, UK) was used to administer the 4 separate questionnaires developed in phase 1. The international expert group (100 experts from 19 countries) rated red flag statements based on the evidence presented (phase 1) and their own experience. Each section reports separately on how many experts were involved in the consensus process for that section. Another

FIGURE 3. Decision tool for early identification of potential serious spinal pathology, step 3. Consider the pathway for emergency/urgent referral if indicated. Safety netting is a management strategy used for people who may present with possible serious pathology. These strategies should include advice on which signs and symptoms to look out for, which action to take if symptoms deteriorate, and the time frame within which action should be taken.

[ position statement ]

Anonymized responses were returned online using a rating scale between 1 and 9 (1 being totally inappropriate, 9 being totally appropriate). All results were reviewed by the steering committee.

We calculated the median score for each statement. Statements with a median score of 7 or above were classed as consensus appropriate, and those with a median score of 3.5 or less were classed as consensus inappropriate. Any remaining items that had not gained consensus by this point were reviewed by the steering committee, and a consensus decision was then taken to either include or exclude these items in the draft framework.

# Phase 3

The draft framework was developed by the steering group based on a synthesis of the results from phases 1 and 2.

# Phase 4

The draft framework was presented to an international peer-review group (70 individuals) for opinion on the content, independent of the people taking part in phase 2. The international peer-review group was invited to rate the content via an online questionnaire. The review group rated each section of the framework based on the following criteria:

- Applicability: relevance to the clinical practice
- Acceptability: clinical usefulness or helpfulness
- Readability: ease of reading

They were also able to offer suggestions on changes/improvements. This peer-review group included chiropractors, osteopaths, physical therapists, experts by experience, and member organization delegates of the IFOMPT. The response rate of 41% included individuals from 13 countries. The median score for each section was calculated. All sections gained a median score of 7 or above and were therefore classed as appropriate according to the Haute Autorité de Santé method. All comments were reviewed by the steering committee and relevant changes made to the framework.

# Phase 5

Based on the phase 4 feedback, the steering group developed the final version of the clinical framework.

# Cauda Equina Syndrome

The cauda equina comprises 20 nerve roots that originate from the conus medullaris at the base of the spinal cord. Cauda equina syndrome occurs as a result of compression of these neural structures. Cauda equina syndrome is challenging to diagnose and manage in a timely manner. It may present in any clinical setting, and clinicians must effectively and efficiently reason through their findings to provide timely management. Timely diagnosis is essential to avoid life-changing outcomes such as ongoing bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction, along with psychosocial consequences.

Literature and International Consensus

Three key source papers were used to formulate the international consensus questionnaire for this section on CES (APPENDIX B). The questionnaire was sent to 23 international experts and contained 25 items (TABLES 2 through 6).

Epidemiology

The incidence of CES in the United Kingdom has been estimated to be 0.002%. The overall prevalence of CES has been estimated to range from 1 in 33,000 to 1 in 100,000 persons. Point prevalence of CES as a cause of low back pain (LBP) is estimated at 0.04% in primary care and 0.4% in tertiary care. Cauda equina syndrome is a complication of approximately 2% of all herniated discs. The incidence of postoperative CES is estimated to be between 0.08% and 0.2%.

Twenty-three percent of litigation claims for spinal surgery in England relate to CES, according to an assessment of litigation claims in England between 2013-2015 and 2015-2016.

Risk Factors

Compression of the cauda equina usually occurs as a result of a disc prolapse. However, any space-occupying lesion could cause cauda equina compression. Relevant symptoms that can be precursors to CES are unilateral or bilateral radicular pain, dermatomal reduced sensation, and myotomal weakness.

If symptoms progress from the precursors described above, with any suggestion of changes in bladder or bowel function or saddle sensory disturbance, then suspect CES. Clinical cue cards and credit card–size patient information handouts can aid communicating sensitive, sometimes subtle but important symptoms, and should form the basis of your questioning.

Clinical Picture

If you suspect CES, perform a full neurological assessment to establish dermatome sensory loss, myotome weakness, or reflex changes. A digital rectal examination is no longer considered essential in a primary care setting in the United Kingdom. It is necessary in secondary care to evaluate loss of anal sphincter tone. Sensation to light touch and pinprick throughout the saddle region, including the buttocks, inner thighs, and perianal region, is a necessary test in any clinical situation. These intimate objective tests must only be performed by an appropriately trained clinician, with a chaperone for the benefit of both the person and the

Spinal Fracture

Spinal fractures make up the largest number of serious pathologies in the spine. While these are predominantly a risk for older patients, especially women, clinicians need to be aware of the risk factors and signs and symptoms of spinal fractures and to consider what detailed questions to ask to help with further management.

Five key source papers were used to formulate the international consensus questionnaire for spinal fracture23,50,63,72,85 (APPENDIX B). The questionnaire was sent to 28 international experts and contained 27 items (TABLES 7 through 11).

# Epidemiology

Estimates for the point prevalence of osteoporotic compression fracture as a cause of LBP range between 0.7% and 4.5% in the primary care setting16,35,41,73,80 and 6.5% in the emergency care setting.29 Low-impact or nontraumatic fractures are the most common serious pathology in the spine, with vertebral fractures being the most common osteoporotic fracture. Approximately 12% of women between 50 and 70 years of age and up to 20% of those over 70 years of age have vertebral fractures. As much as 70% of these fractures are undiagnosed and found during investigation for other health conditions.

It is important to identify people with vertebral fractures, as they are more likely to sustain later hip fractures, bringing further health consequences and risk for the person. Red flags purported to indicate possible fracture are unhelpful in the early stages. On physical examination, the person may have an increased prominence of the spinous process at the affected level, and increased kyphosis. The person may be tender to percussion at the affected level, though absence of this should not reassure the clinician that there is no fracture. People with a suspected fracture should have an X-ray in the first instance to determine whether a fracture is present, and to grade and define the nature of the fracture.

# Risk Factors

An increasing number of younger people are affected by insufficiency spinal fractures (fractures caused by normal stresses on weakened bone), due to a range of risk factors. These include excessive alcohol consumption (risk increases when drinking greater than 3 units per day), vitamin D deficiency, long-term corticosteroid use (greater than 5 or 7.5 mg per day over a 3-month period), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, smoking (greater than 20 cigarettes per day), dietary restriction, eating disorders, and absorption problems from the gut (eg, Crohn’s disease). Establish the presence or absence of these risk factors with detailed history taking.

# Clinical Picture

People commonly present with sudden onset of pain, mostly located in the thoracolumbar region, following low-impact trauma such as a slip or trip or lifting something while in a flexed position. The pain varies in presentation, but is often severe and mostly localized to the area of the fracture. Weight-bearing activities and active movements are restricted and painful, and the person may require strong analgesia, particularly in the area of the fracture.

Case 2

A 60-year-old woman presents wip moderately severe poracolumbar pain after bending over and lifting a heavy pot in pe garden 3 weeks ago. Her pain is slightly improved. She is operwise well and not on any medication oper pan paracetamol for her pain. She has no history of fracture. She had an early menopause at age 35. She smokes 20 cigarettes per day. She has pain in extension and rotation, some local spinal tenderness, and zygapophyseal (facet) joint tenderness bilaterally.

- Age and sex are risk factors (although she is under 65 years of age)
- Early menopause
- Smokes 20 cigarettes per day
- Clinical action: treat and monitor symptoms. While there are some risk factors, her symptoms are recent and improving, and she is on low-dose medication for pain. She does not require imaging, and it would be safe to treat her and monitor progress without further investigation at this stage

Case 4

A 74-year-old man wip mid-poracic and lumbar pain presents wip increasing pain locally in pe spine, but no trauma/injury. Pain is worse in lying and standing and eased slightly in sitting. He is taking increasing doses and strengps of analgesia, which helps a little. He has some shortness of breap on exertion and pain on deep inspiration. He is a nonsmoker and drinks 3 pints of beer a day. He had a transurepral resection of pe prostate for prostate cancer 10 years ago and has been discharged from follow-up by pe urologist.

- Age and site of pain
- Worsening pain
- Increasing analgesia
- Alcohol intake
- History of prostate cancer
- Breathlessness
- Clinical action: urgent MRI of the whole spine. The man has several risk factors for spinal fracture. These include a history of prostate cancer, which is one of the cancers most likely to metastasize to the spine. His pain is worse in lying, which is more unusual and may indicate underlying serious pathology (tumor). His age puts him at risk of osteoporosis, even though he is male, as his bone density is likely to have decreased. His shortness of breath on exertion and pain on deep inspiration are concerning symptoms that require urgent investigation.

breath may be a concern in the absence of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or smoking history, given his prostate cancer. This man would benefit from further investigation of his spine with whole-spine MRI to exclude metastases and fracture. A chest X-ray would be appropriate to exclude lung metastases/disease, and blood tests would be relevant to exclude myeloma and look for signs of inflammation, infection, or increased bone turnover. If one is not able to request these medical tests, then urgent referral would be appropriate

# Risk Factors

The second most common serious pathology to affect the spine, after fracture, is MBD as a consequence of a primary cancer. More effective medical treatment of primary cancers means people are living longer, putting them at greater risk of later developing MBD. Cancer can affect all ages, but the risk of developing malignancy increases with age. The consequences of untreated or late diagnosis are widespread metastases and visceral involvement. Metastatic bone disease can lead to significant morbidity and reduction in quality of life due to MSCC and, in the worst-case scenario, to paralysis and compromise of the bladder, bowel, and sexual function.

# Clinical Picture

The spine is one of the earliest sites affected by MBD, especially in those cancers that have a propensity to metastasize. The 5 most common cancers to metastasize are breast, prostate, lung, kidney, and thyroid. Approximately 30% of all people with one of these primary diagnoses of cancer will have their cancer metastasize, so it is important not to subject all people with a history of cancer to unnecessary and worrying investigations. In breast cancer, MBD can occur at any time, with 50% occurring within the first 5 years after a primary diagnosis of cancer and the other 50% developing 10 years and later.

|Past history of cancer|Not all those cancers with a predilection to bone metastases will develop them. However, some will metastasize in the first 5 y of diagnosis, with 50% doing so 10-20 y later.

|Thoracic pain|The thoracic spine is the most common site of MBD. It is important to note that MBD may not correspond to the sensory level of pain|Is the area sensitive to touch? Is it mechanical in presentation?|Appears mechanical, but caution needs to be applied here. Often, MBD gives the impression of being mechanical in nature, appearing to initially respond to treatment|May be painful on percussion over the area of pain. May not be a mechanical pain pattern|

|MRI|MRI is the gold standard for diagnosing MBD. Because the sensory level does not always correspond to the level of metastases if MBD is suspected, MRI of the whole spine is required|
|CT scan|If there are contraindications to MRI|
|Blood tests|There is no combination of inflammatory markers that can be used as a reliable rule-in or rule-out test strategy. The decision to test must be made in the context of other clinical findings|

Absence of a history of cancer, as MSCC can be the first sign of metastases in approximately 25% of people who do not have a primary diagnosis of cancer and are subsequently diagnosed with MSCC. Metastatic spinal cord compression can occur as a consequence of MBD when there is pathological vertebral-body collapse or where direct tumor growth causes compression of the spinal cord, leading to irreversible neurological damage.

A high index of suspicion, early diagnosis with referral for urgent investigation, and prompt treatment can result in better outcomes in terms of function and prognosis. Careful questioning using good communication skills is essential in early identification. The use of credit card–size patient information handouts can aid in communication between clinicians and patients.

Metastases can affect any region of the spine, most commonly the thoracic spine (70%), but also the cervical spine (10%) and lumbar spine (20%). Primary tumors that are at high risk of metastasizing are those that were large at diagnosis, diagnosed at a late stage of the disease (stage 3 or 4), or had lymph node involvement with radical treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy.

# Suggested Pathway for Emergency/Urgent Referral

Refer to the clinical decision tool for suggested pathways for emergency/urgent referral (FIGURE 3).

# Spinal Infection

Spinal infection is an infectious disease that affects the spinal structures, including the vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and adjacent paraspinal tissues. In high-income and upper middle–income countries, spinal infection has steadily increased over recent years, possibly due to an aging population and an increase in intravenous drug abuse. In lower middle–income and lower-income countries, spinal infection has increased due to the dual epidemic of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB).

For further country-specific information on TB, see https://www.wwl.nhs.uk/library/general_docs/specialties/a_to_z/t/tb-service-who-estimates-of-tuberculosis-incidence-by-country.pdf, and for further information on the global burden of the dual epidemic of HIV/AIDS and TB, see the World Health Organization.

Staphylococcus aureus and Brucella are the other main bacteria that are identified in reports on spinal infection.

Two key source papers were used to formulate the international consensus questionnaire for this section on spinal infection (APPENDIX B). The questionnaire was sent to 21 international experts and contained 56 items (TABLES 17 through 21).

Epidemiology Spinal infections, such as TB, discitis, and spinal abscesses, are uncommon. The incidence is 0.2 to 2.4 cases per 100 000 annually in Western societies. Spinal infection represents 2% to 7% of all musculoskeletal infections. The point prevalence of spinal infection in developed countries is estimated at 0.0004% (across all settings). The point prevalence of infection presenting as nonmechanical LBP is estimated at 0.01% in primary care and 1.2% in a tertiary setting, where post-procedural discitis represents up to 30% of all cases.

Discitis mostly affects the lumbar spine (58%), followed by the thoracic spine (30%) and cervical spine (11%), whereas TB lesions mainly affect the thoracic spine, and often at more than 2 levels.

The frequency of spinal infections presenting in a clinical setting depends on the demographics of where you work. Due to the rarity of spinal infection in high-income countries, the diagnosis of spinal infection is often delayed, because clinicians fail to recognize the relevant red flags and consider spinal infection as a potential differential diagnosis.

|How did your back pain start?|No evidence of progressive symptoms and the person is not able to pinpoint symptoms|Localized progressive pain that limits movement significantly|
|Are your symptoms getting better, worse, or remaining the same?| | |
|Can you point to where your symptoms are?| | |
|Do you have any pins or needles or numbness?|No distally referred symptoms or subjective neurological symptoms|People with bilateral/quadrilateral neurological symptoms, including gait disturbance and coordination issues/bladder and bowel disturbance|
|Have you noticed any weakness in your legs?|If the person does not describe any neurological symptoms, continue to evaluate for possible change| |
|Do you feel fit and well?|No evidence of fatigue|Describes a level of fatigue that is abnormal for them when carrying out their usual tasks|
|Have you noticed any changes in your ability to carry out activities that normally you manage easily?| | |
|Have you experienced a fever or chills since the onset of your back pain?|The absence of fever should not be reassuring; it should be monitored|Person reports fever within the time frame since onset of back pain. Concern that person might be developing sepsis|
|Is your weight steady?|Weight loss related to medication or change in diet. Weight loss has stabilized. Can be attributed to other causes|Person has lost more than 5% of body weight over a 3- to 6-month period|

Clinical Picture: In cases of spinal infection, the time between onset and diagnosis is often prolonged. People can remain relatively healthy until symptoms manifest in the later stages of the disease. Unlike malignancy, where symptoms wax and wane, spinal infection has a more linear progression, with back pain being the most common presenting symptom, which can progress to neurological symptoms. If not treated in a timely manner, the condition can progress with serious complications such as paralysis or instability of the spine, and can ultimately be fatal.

Diagnosis: The subjective history should consider determinants that can be divided into comorbidities, environmental factors, and social factors. Comorbidities that suppress a patient’s immune system, such as diabetes, HIV, long-term steroid use, and smoking, put the person at risk of infection. Consider social and environmental factors like intravenous drug use, obesity, birth in a TB-endemic country, family history of TB, and living conditions (overcrowded living, homelessness, imprisonment, or rural environment). Spinal surgery is a key risk factor for spinal infection, in particular multiple revision surgery of the lumbar spine, with an added increased risk for obese people. The classic triad of clinical features comprises back pain, fever, and neurological dysfunction. However, many people do not present with all 3 features. Only 50% of people report fever as a symptom. Absence of fever cannot rule out spinal infection.

Clinical-Reasoning Scenarios

Case 1: A 47-year-old ex-heroin addict presents with recurrent episodes of LBP and a previous history of back pain. He describes symptoms that are intermittent. He is very inactive and usually self-treats the problem with rest.

- Male
- Ex-drug addict
- No other concerning features
- Clinical action: treat and monitor symptoms, discuss and document a clear strategy to follow if symptoms

# APPENDIX A

# DEFINITIONS

- Clinical risk/index of suspicion: relates to clinical risk factors and presenting clinical features. Once the index of suspicion passes a critical threshold, the therapist will become concerned about the underlying cause of the person’s complaint
- Emergency referral: this needs to reflect local pathways, but, as a guide, on the same day
- Experts by experience: patient representatives
- General practitioner review: follow-up by medical practitioner; onward medical management to be carried out by the general practitioner
- High level of evidence: evidence supported by the literature
- Investigations: refers to requesting imaging or ordering blood tests to aid diagnosis
- Low level of evidence: evidence supported by consensus and the steering group
- Red flag: Goodman and Snyder2 define red flags as features of the individual’s medical history and clinical examination thought to be associated with a high risk of serious disorders such as infection, inflammation, cancer, or fracture. Red flags are clinical prediction guides—they are not diagnostic tests, and they are not necessarily predictors of diagnosis or prognosis. The main role of red flags is that, when combined, they help to raise the clinician’s index of suspicion. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, the prognostic strength of individual red flags or combinations of red flags is not known
- Safety netting: safety netting is a management strategy used for people who may present with possible serious pathology. These strategies should include advice on which signs and symptoms to look out for, which action to take, and the time frame within which that action needs to be taken
- Shared decision making: the conversation that happens between a patient and a clinician to reach a health care choice together
- Urgent referral: this needs to reflect local pathways, but, as a guide, within 5 days
- Watchful waiting: the act of close surveillance while undergoing treatment as required, but allowing time to pass before medical intervention or therapy is used

# APPENDIX B

|Pathology|Papers Reviewed, n|Patients, n|Evidence Statement|
|---|---|---|---|
|CES1|7|569|Red flags commonly used to screen for CES are not robust enough to diagnose CES on their own, as their diagnostic accuracy is poor. That being said, red flags still remain important clinical markers for the suspicion of CES, as presently they are the best tools that general health care practitioners have to screen for this serious condition|
|CES4|NA|NA|Policy document outlining best standards of care In patients with symptoms suggestive of CES, with confirmed cauda equina compression on MRI, the recommended treatment of choice is urgent surgical decompression Nothing is to be gained by delaying surgery, and potentially there is much to be lost. Decompressive surgery should be undertaken at the earliest opportunity, taking into consideration the duration of pre-existing symptoms and the potential for increased morbidity, while operating in the small hours. We do not consider that there is anything in the literature that justifies contravention of this principle. We recommend that reasons for any delay in surgery be documented|
|CES5|NA|NA|A number of authors, including Henschke et al,7 Downie et al,2 and Verhagen et al,12 have published high-quality review papers demonstrating that red flags have a weak evidence base|
|Fracture13|8|7378|The available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with LBP. From the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture|
|Fracture11|NA|NA|NA|
|Fracture9|4 guidelines|NA|Overall, none of the guidelines was of satisfactory quality. The domains with the lowest scores were rigor of development and applicability|
|Fracture38|NA|NA|NA|
|Fracture|NA|NA|Evidence rating: C—consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series|
|Malignancy6|8|7361|For most “red flags,” there is insufficient evidence to provide recommendations regarding their diagnostic accuracy or usefulness for detecting spinal malignancy|
|Infection14|41|2058|The current evidence surrounding red flags for SI remains of low quality, and clinical features alone should not be relied on to identify SI|
|Infection10|NA|NA|NA|

Abbreviations: CES, cauda equina syndrome; LBP, low back pain; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NA, not applicable; SI, spinal infection.
